# Character Occurrence

You are tasked with writing a function that will accept a string as an argument and a character as an argument and count the number of times that character shows up in the string.


Example 1:

Checking the number of times 'l' shows up in 'Hello'

```js

occurence("Hello", "l"); //2
```


Example 2:

Checking the number of times 't' shows up in 'What is the time'

```js

occurence("What is the time", "t"); //3
```

Your solution should be case-insensitive (lower case 'l' will also map to 'L' and vice-versa).

## How to test

Once you have written your solution, please execute `npm test` to check to see if your program passes all the test cases. Make sure you use `npm install` to install any depedencies required.
