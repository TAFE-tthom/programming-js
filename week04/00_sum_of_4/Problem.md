# Sum of 4

You will need to implement a function that will sum 4 numbers given as arguments. You will need to implement the function below in the `sum.js` file.

```js
function sumOfFour(a, b, c, d)
```

The `sumOfFour` function has 4 parameters (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`), each parameter is assumed to be a number and as such, when called, will be supplied with a number.

The function `sumOfFour` must add all 4 numbers together and return the result.

```js

let result = sumOfFour(1, 2, 3, 4);

console.log(result); //Outputs: 10

```

```js

let result = sumOfFour(4, 5, 1, 10);

console.log(result); //Outputs: 20

```
