# Average

You have been tasked with writing the function `computeAverage` that will compute the average of an array of numbers.

```js
function computeAverage(input)
```

Your `computeAverage` function will need to return a value that represents the average of the array of numbers. If the array of numbers is empty, `0` will be returned.

Example 1:

```js

let nums = [1, 4, 6]
let result = computeAverage(nums); //4.0
  
```


Example 2:

```js

let nums = [1, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
let result = computeAverage(nums); //8.5
  
```

Example 3:

```js

let nums = [1, 10, 20, 50]
let result = computeAverage(nums); //20.25
  
```


## How to test

You are able to test your program using `npm test`, if you happen to run into an issue, please make sure the dependencies are installed using `npm install`.
