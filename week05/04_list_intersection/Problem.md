# List Intersection

You are tasked with implementing a static method that will
compute a new array that contains elements that two other lists have in common.

You will need to implement the method:

```
function intersection(arrayA, arrayB)
```

`arrayA` and `arrayB` may have elements in common. Any common elements
would be included in a new list, any duplicate elements would not be
included in the final array.

If there are no common elements, the new list would be empty.


## How to test

You can test your code using `npm test`.
