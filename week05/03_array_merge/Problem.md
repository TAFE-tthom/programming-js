# Adding Arrays

You have been tasked with writing a function that will be able to create a brand new array out of two other arrays.

```
function join(arrayA, arrayB)
```

You will need to copy the contents from A and B into the new array. You must start with copying the contents from the first array and then the second.

## How to test your solution

After implementing your solution, you can check to see if you pass all the test cases by running the command `npm run test`.

This will run it against the test cases bundled with this solution.
