# Stack

You are tasked with constructing a stack data structure. Following a similar pattern to the Queue data structure you constructed prior, you will need to implement the following
methods.

* `push(element)` - Puts an element to the top of the stack
* `pop()` - Removes an element from the top of the stack, if the stack is empty, null is returned
* `peek()` - Returns an item at the top of the list, if the stack is empty, null is returned
* `length()` - Returns the number of elements on the stack


## How to test?

You are able to test your solution against a suite of test cases, using `npm test`.
