# Scissors

Your task is to implement a function called `scissors`, this function has two parameters, the file path as a string and the index column of the file. The index themselves start at 1 (not 0 as usually is with array so you will need to factor that into your implementation).

The goal is to return an array of the content on a particular column in the file.

Example 1, file is `cats.txt` and the index is `1`:
``` 
Ginger
Mainecoon
Lynx
Ocelot
```

Example 2, file is `dogs.txt` and the index is `2`:
```
GreatDane
Mastiff
Shephard
Wolf
```

Example 3, file is `dogs.txt` and the index is `3`:
```
Akita
Doberman
Bulldog
Husky
```
