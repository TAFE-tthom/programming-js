# Area of a Triangle

Write a function that calculates the area of a triangle:

A=\frac{bh}{2}

Your function will take the base and height. The area should be printed to two decimal places.

Structure:
```
function triangleArea(base, height) {

  // Your code goes inside this function
  //
  
  return 0;
}
```

Example:
```
let result = triangleArea(5, 3) //7.50
  
```


## How to test

You can test your solution using `npm test`, make sure you install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
