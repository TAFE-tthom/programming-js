# Command Check

This is a simple exercise to ensure that you are able to download, read the problem document, install the dependencies, write a solution and run it against test cases.

1. Make sure you run `npm install` inside the project folder, this is used for installing `jest` which is a test framework.

2. Once this is installed, you should write a solution in `cmd_check.js` which is simple asking you to set a string for the return value to 'OK!'.

3. After you have set the string value to 'OK!', you can run the test associated with the project using `npm test`.

4. If, after running `npm test`, you observed `Tests: 1 Passed, 1 Tota`, you have met the requirements for this task and can move onto the next one.

Do not move on from this exercise until you have passed the test case.
